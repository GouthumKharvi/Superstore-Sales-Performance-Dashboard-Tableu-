# Superstore-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Tableu-
This project provides an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Superstoreâ€™s sales performance from 2018 to 2021. The dashboard allows users to filter data by date, segment, ship mode, and state, providing a flexible view into various sales metrics and trends.

## Solution Summary

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Connected to the Sample Superstore dataset and created an extract for improved performance.
   - Cleaned and formatted data as needed to support visualization requirements.

2. **Dashboard Design and Layout**:
   - Configured a fixed-size dashboard (Width: 1055, Height: 850) for consistent layout and alignment.
   - Organized components into containers for structured, easy-to-navigate sections, including a title, filters, KPIs, and visualizations.
   - Used horizontal containers to group similar elements together and a vertical container to align these sections.

3. **Filters and Interactivity**:
   - Added `Order Date`, `Segment`, `Ship Mode`, and `State` filters to allow customized data exploration.
   - Configured `Order Date` as a range filter for flexible time period selection.
   - Set up actionable filters in the Pie and Bubble charts for additional interactivity, allowing users to explore data by region and sub-category dynamically.

4. **KPI Scorecards**:
   - Created scorecards for key metrics:
     - **Total Sales**: Displayed in thousands with custom color (`#76b7b2`).
     - **Total Profit**: Displayed in thousands with matching formatting.
     - **Total Volume**: Displayed as a count value.
     - **Sales Per Customer**: Computed and displayed with the same color theme.
   - Tooltips were disabled on these views to maintain focus on the metrics.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - **Pie Chart**: Showcases the percent of total sales by region, with a summer color palette and black borders. Tooltip displays region, percentage, and sales in thousands for clear comparison.
   - **Top N States Bar Chart**: Horizontal bar chart showing top states by sales, customizable with a parameter to adjust the number of states shown. Sorted in descending order with sales values labeled in dollars.
   - **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes sales by sub-category, with bubbles colored by category. Tooltip includes only the sub-category and sales in thousands for a clean look.
   - **Line Chart**: Displays monthly sales trends over time, with the X-axis formatted to show month and year (e.g., Jan 22). Tooltip includes sales in thousands for each month-year.

6. **Styling and Formatting**:
   - Applied consistent color themes across metrics and visualizations for a cohesive look.
   - Adjusted tooltips, legends, and chart borders to ensure clarity and visual appeal.
   - Positioned legends strategically next to their respective charts, avoiding overlap and keeping the layout uncluttered.

7. **Publishing and Finalization**:
   - Hidden all individual sheets for a polished final dashboard.
   - Published the dashboard to Tableau Public, making it accessible for viewing and sharing.
